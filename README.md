# TruveHunt
A simple game on CLI similar to Bandit, but a little easier.
This is the first time I am making something of this kind. 
I will try my best to add new levels whenever possible.
I would really appriciate if you make new levels and make a MR.


---Before starting the game open the DO_NOT_CHEAT folder and run ./.start.sh

Objective :- Find all the heroes in order to complete the game. For now there are 7 heroes hiding.

**HINT-1**
--the first hero is hiding in the file DO_NOT_CHEAT. Find him and he will reveal a hint to find the other hero.

Hope you enjoy it.
All the hero names are in txtfiles.
